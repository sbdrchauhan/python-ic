I am thankful to [Learn to Program: The Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program/home/welcome) for the following knowledge.

**Developing a Program**: *From start to finish*

Given: An assignment grades of a class of students. It has 3 lines header, space and then student Id followed by grade.
We are given 'Assignment 1 grades.txt' file that contains our data.
We build: 'a1_hist.txt'

We want: We want to see the distribution of the grades.

To do:

- Read the grades into a list
- Count teh grades per range
- Write the histogram to the file

We make the main program as `grade_histogram.py` while all the functions required to do it in `grade.py` file.

From the beginning, we document, we check the progress and see if program does what we expect. This is crucial, as we progess more and more and if we write 100s of lines of codes and try to check, it will be very troublesome at that point.
